# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow and learning some of the basics of GitHub
My name is Andrew Catalano and I am a third year student here at Eastern Michigan University. With my degree, I am hoping to go into software development as a profession, working with companies to add features to applications, fix bugs, and help with the overall smoothness of usage. My dream company to work for is the Rocket company. This is because I know someone who works in their building as a technician and they said that the whole building seems happy and healthy all the time.
